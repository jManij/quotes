# Lab 08 Design
 -Functionality and Tests
  - Can check if the length is greater than 0
  - Can check to see we do not get a null object
  - We are using a file called, "recentquotes.json" and we are using gson to parse the file. We then create a method that         randomly generates a single quote from the file and returns it.
  - Can systemprintout out the randomly generated quote from return "printString"
# How to Run?
- Clone the repo: https://github.com/jManij/quotes

Testing from terminal:
   - cd to quotes
   - run the following command: './gradlew test'
   - All the tests should pass.
   
Testing from IJ:
  - Via import project, choose "quotes"
  - run the following command: './gradlew test'
  - All the tests should pass.
